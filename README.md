# KloutKast
Welcome to the Kloutkast development Readme. In this application we strive to achieve better standards, quality, and user experience when solving complex issues.

## Installation

Kloutkast required you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.8.1 (npm v6.10.2) installed and being used on your machine.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and run frontend.

```sh
npm run start
```

## Development

Before adding packages please consider the following..
- Can it be solved with out it?
- What other packages similar to this one have already been added?
- Could there be a faster way to get this done?

## Branches
Main branch is the most protected branch which is where the production app is stored. The Staging branch is where, you guess it, where the staging app is stored. Branches are protected therefore will need a review before any code is merged into the staging and/or production environments. Branches must be created using the following syntax `<Organization>-<Ticket No>`. You can find a reference to this on Linear.


## Commits

Code commits must contain valuable information on why it was commited. See below for reference guide on how to make useful commits.

Consider the following questions when committing:
- Whatâ€™s changed?
- What problems are you solving with these design changes?
- What should reviewers look for?
- What should they test out?
